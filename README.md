![API Preview](api-preview.png)

This is the API for a lightweight version of Jupyter notebooks built using FastAPI and MongoDB. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete Python notebooks and execute Python code within these notebooks. It's designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to run Python code in an interactive manner âœ¨

that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributing.

```shell
tox -e lint          # code style
tox -e static        # static analysis
tox -e unit          # unit tests
tox -e integration   # integration tests
```

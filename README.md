# Jupyter Backend API

This is the API for a lightweight version of Jupyter notebooks built using FastAPI and MongoDB. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete Python notebooks and execute Python code within these notebooks. It's designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to run Python code in an interactive manner âœ¨
